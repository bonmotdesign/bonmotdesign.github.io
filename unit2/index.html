            <p><strong>Louvre Thumbnail 00 </strong></p>
           FOCAL POINT: The main image occupies half the homepage is a slideshow of the museum's exterior and highlights from the collection. The splashscreen is a cropped image of I.M. Pei's glass triangle entrance to the Louvre, its modernized brand symbol. This is an interesting use of a pattern as background. Secondary focus below main image is a photo grid, two rows with three images.</p></strong>

            HIERARCHY:  Following the main image slideshow is a stacked trio of photos with captions and general information. Scrolling of the page reveals three rows of three images with captions followed by six columns of text. An interesting navigation feature is a fixed tool bar for searches, daily program, tickets and gift shop. Main = 1, followed by 4 x 3, followed by 1 x 6.</p></strong>

            <p><strong>Louvre Thumbnail 00 </strong></p>
            BALANCE: Brick and morter is how I might describe the site design. The visual emphasis is top and center with a main image and additional information is nested below in decreasing size and importance. Scrolling two to three screen depths is necessary to reach the end of the information. The Louvre LOGO at top left is the homepage link.</p></strong></ul>

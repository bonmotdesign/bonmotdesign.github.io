        <h1>UNIT 2: Build Your Design Challenge</h1>


        <h2>Q. Whick two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

             <p><strong>A: </strong>I wanted to compare the sites of two museums, MoMA and The Louvre. Located in major art capitals, both have an international reputation and audience, so an online presence is key to attract museumgoers to its exhibitions,programs and membership opportunities. Multi-language access and ecommerce are essential to its business remotely and onsite.</p>

        <h2>Q. How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2></p>

            <h3>MoMA</h3>

            <ul><li><p><strong>FOCAL POINTS: </strong>The homepage features a full-screen, self-playing slideshow featuring six main images in rotation from a featured exhbition. Its landing page has motion activated captions and pop-up mini-slideshow, with thumbnails of the main slideshow. 

            <li><p><strong>HIERARCHY: </strong>Navigational links are curiously buried at the bottom of the homepage and easy to miss. On secondary pages, a repetitive horizontal grid format (2, 4, 6) in a descending order lead the eye left/right and down in striking contrast to the freeform homepage.</p>

            <li><p><strong>BALANCE: </strong>Navigational links are unfortunately buried at the bottom of the homepage and easy to miss. Secondary pages are visual clones of one another with links forward and back through sections. The effect is clean and minimal.</p></ul>

            <h3>The LOUVRE</h3>


            <ul><li><p><strong>FOCAL POINTS: </strong>The homepage features a main image at half-screen size and is a self-playing slideshow mixing scenes of it's well-known exterior and highlights from the collection. The splashscreen is an  image of I.M. Pei's glass triangle entrance to the Louvre, which has become its brand icon and interesting use of an abstract pattern as background.  A photo of I.M. Pei's glass triangle entrance  used as splashscreen fortunately gives a welcome contrast to the white text on black background on all pages. 

             <li><p><strong>HIERARCHY: </strong>
                Below the main image slideshow is a stacked trio of photos with captions and general information that decrease in size of two rows with three images each followed by a smaller grid of six text boxes. Scrolling of the page reveals three more rows with three columns of captions followed by another row of six columns of text. At the bottom is a small navigation bar with links for searches, daily program, tickets and gift shop.</p>

             <li><p><strong>BALANCE: </strong>
                The depth of the homepage and row after row of photo grids and captioning makes the site feel dense. A wealth of information with white text on black creates a sense of confinement creates a brick and morter effect, serviceable without enjoyment. The visual emphasis is top and center with a main image and additional information is nested below in decreasing size and importance. Scrolling two to three screen depths is necessary to reach the end of the information. The Louvre LOGO at top left is the homepage link.

     

        </p></strong></ul><h2>Q. What makes them similar and different?</h2>

            <p><strong>SIMILARITIES: </strong>
            While MoMA's modernist architecture is home to its famed holdings, its website focuses on mainly on its exhibitions and programs. The homepage opens with an kinetic, full-page slideshow followed by a color-coded grid structure on subsequent pages. The grids stack is size, from top to bottom, and the subdivision of rows increase by depth as well. </p>

            The Louvre buildings are a main draw as well its collections, so architectural images are integrated along with collection highlights. Its homepage also uses one main images with a slideshow in rotation followed by grided stacks of descending size and importance to a much greater scrollable page depth.</p>

            <p><strong>DIFFERENCES: </strong>
            MoMA uses page grids beginning with page 2, top to bottom. The grid stack format which repeats on following pages, decreases in size top to bottom left to right columns while maintaining a fixed depth and contained to one page screen or horizontal navigation. Overall page depth is kept to one screen, eliminating page scrolls and use of page links for quick navigation. Its background is white with no splashpage images. Its page background is white without a splashpage image.</p>

            The Louvre grid hierarchy is introducted immediately on the homepage with use of sub-grids multiple 3-columns rows and ending with a 6 column row of text. The net effect is an dense amount information confined in a black background. Overall page depth is sometimes three screens in deep requiring page scrolls and more time-consuming navigation. Its page background is black with a background splashpage image.</p>

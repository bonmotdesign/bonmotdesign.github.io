I’m interested in FEWD as an extension of digital storytelling and will integrate WEB/UX, Interactive Design and Social Media for business startups and communities for social good</h3>

        <h1>My Mission</h1>

             <h3>As I add UX/WEB to my arsenal of talent, I want to facilitate digital storytelling for those wishing to spread their message. This week I was paired on a project through TapRoot for The Dalai Lama Fellows in CA. They embody the things I live for – creativity, compassion, collaboration and humor. Have you ever heard the Dalai Lama laugh? I'ts infectious!</h3>
